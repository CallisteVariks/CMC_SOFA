Taking into consideration the amount of widely daily used programming languages in the
past years, we have taken as an inspiration the lesser known R language where (as a simple
example) you can print out by simply calling .cat.
Hence, by creating the SOFA programming language, we want to let the beginner to
intermediate programmers know that whatever inspiration you would have, you could create your
own language, express yourself and invent something new anytime, anywhere, whether it would
be at a coffee place, at a friendâ€™s place, in the park, or just by sitting home on your comfy sofa.
